# jurassic-park-security-interface
A recreation of the Jurassic Park System Security Interface

The system is created with a Bash script and comes prebuilt with the following commands:
- access security
- access security grid
- access main security grid
- exit

It also incorportes some simple error checking.

You can run this by opening the folder and making sure main.sh is executable by running 
```bash
chmod +x main.sh
```
then run start the mainframe with
```bash
./main.sh
```


I created this just because I am excited about the new Jurrasic Park movie - let's hope they upgrade the mainframe look in this version!
